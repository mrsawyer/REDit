REDit is an application like a Product Hunt / Reddit clone that transforms existing data into a view using posts and categories

# Motivation
REDit was created as a requirement for an app development project at RED Academy 

# Key Takeaways
The main motivation behind the creation of this website was to become more familiar using React & Redux to build an application. These goals were achieved through the creation of REDit. As can be seen through out the code, many different techniques, properties, and organizations were used.

The site was designed using Visual Studio Code. Many references were made to Mozilla Developer Network, Stack Overflow, RED resources, and others.
